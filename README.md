**Introduction**: Noise fundamentally constrains the detection limit of astronomical observations. We present **ASTERIS**, a self-supervised denoising transformer **integrating spatiotemporal information across multiple exposures** to enhance detection limits  (the backbone was inspired by **[Restormer](https://github.com/swz30/Restormer)**). Quantitative mock tests are developed for scientific benchmarking, illustrating that ASTERIS improves practical detection limits over existing methods by **1.0 magnitude** at 90% completeness and purity, while preserving point-spread-function fidelity and photometric accuracy. Experimental validations on the ü™ê**James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)** and the ‚òÑÔ∏è**Subaru Telescope** demonstrate ASTERIS‚Äôs capability in resolving previously undetectable features.

## üîß Installation

**Environment**

- Ubuntu 20.04.6
- CUDA 12.1
- CONDA 23.9.0
- Python 3.9.23
- Pytorch 2.5.0+cu121

Other versions may work, but we cannot guarantee full compatibility.

Two ways are recommended to set up the environment. **We recommend using the `environment.yml` method** for reproducibility, but manual installation is also possible.

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/freemercury/ASTERIS_THU.git

# Create environment with environment.yml
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

If you prefer to set up the environment manually, follow these steps:

```bash
# 1. Create a new conda environment with Python 3.9
conda create -n asteris python=3.9

# 2. Activate the environment
conda activate asteris

# 3. Install core dependencies
pip install numpy==1.26
pip install torch==2.5.0+cu121 torchvision==0.20.0+cu121 torchaudio==2.5.0+cu121 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121

# 4. Install any additional packages you need
pip install tqdm scipy astropy tifffile scikit-image einops swanlab natsort pathlib
```

## üìÇ Usage

ASTERIS is designed for multi-exposure astronomical imaging data denoising. Below is the standard workflow for preparing data, training models, and running tests.


### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Prepare Training Data

- The training process takes as input a set of **3D `.tif` image stacks** under `./train_datasets/`.  
- In each stack, every frame must be **astrometrically aligned to the same WCS reference**, typically generated during the data reduction of astronomical imaging data.
- Pixle scale of images to be denoised by the pre-trained model needs to be set to **0.04 arcseconds**.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Convert FITS to Training Stacks

- Make subfolders under `./reduction/`.
- Place each **astronomically aligned `.fits` files** of the same pointing into the corresponding `./reduction/XX/`.
- Each subfolder needs **‚â• 8/16 `.fits`** files for **ASTERIS_4/8 training**.
- Run the following script to convert them into `.tif` stacks recognizable by ASTERIS:  

```bash
python ASTERIS_make_train_dataset.py
```

- Script parameters are defined inside `ASTERIS_make_train_dataset.py` and can be tuned as needed.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Train a Model

To start training from scratch, run:
```bash
python ASTERIS_train.py
```
- All training parameters are configurable in the script itself.


### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Test the Model

Place your .fits test images under ./test_datasets/.

Ensure:

- All FITS files in the same sub-directory are astrometrically aligned.

- When using ASTERIS_*M*, each sub-directory must contain at least *M* individual `.fits` files ‚Äî for example, ‚â• 4 for ASTERIS4, ‚â• 8 for ASTERIS8.

- We provide two variants of pre-trained ASTERIS models--4-frame and 8-frame--that can be directly tested. They are trained separately for JWST/NIRCam long-wavelength (center wavelength ‚â• 2.5 Œºm) and short-wavelength (center wavelength < 2.5 Œºm), using the imaging data from **Program IDs [3293](https://www.stsci.edu/jwst-program-info/download/jwst/pdf/3293/), [1210](https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/phase2-public/1210.pdf), [3215](https://www.stsci.edu/jwst-program-info/download/jwst/pdf/3215/), and [1963](https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/phase2-public/1963.pdf)**.

- The **[pre-trained model](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17114980)** can be downloaded here.


Run the testing script:
```bash
python ASTERIS_test.py
```

‚úÖ By following the above steps, you can prepare datasets, train new models, or evaluate ASTERIS on your own astronomical imaging data.

## üí° Examples

We provide demo data and pre-trained model that can be directly tested with ASTERIS.  

1. Download the **[demo data](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17105027)** from [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17105027](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17105027).   
2. Unzip the archive and place the contents into `./test_datasets/`. 
3. Download the **[pre-trained model](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17114980)** from [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17114980](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17114980). 
4. Unzip the archive and place the contents into `./pth/`.  
5. Run the following scripts to test the demo datasets:
```bash
# Test on demo (short wavelengths)
python ASTERIS_test_demo_short.py

# Test on demo (long wavelengths)
python ASTERIS_test_demo_long.py
```
4. The results will be automatically saved under `./results/`.
